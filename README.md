# Laniakea
Laniakea is an application for categorization and re-discovery of starred GitHub repositories. It aims to improve on GitHubs existing starred repository system by allowing users to tag repos with labels that make sense to them and the use these labels to filter their stars down to that one perfect repo when they need it.

This is a work in progress and currently in the early planning phase.  I'm building Laniakea as a learning and portfolio project.  My intention is to be disciplined in planning and execution starting with documenting Requirements and progressing through UX Design and managed agile development.
